# NYC-citibike-visualization
This visualization analyzes and displays information on New York City's Citi Bike Sharing System using Tableau. 

The dashboard offers a comprehensive look at New York City's bike-share system, specifically analyzing usage patterns and station distribution within the five buroughs. Key insights reveal that the system is predominantly utilized by annual members, rather than casual riders, with classic bikes seeing significantly more use than electric bikes. Hourly trip data points to a strong commuter pattern, with peak ridership occurring in the late afternoon and early evening, suggesting that residents primarily use Citi Bike for daily commutes or post-work activities.

Geographically, the map highlights areas of high traffic and activity, indicating robust bike service in these areas. Conversely, large sections of cerain neighborhoods, like the central, eastern, and northern Bronx for example, appear underserved. This presents potential opportunities for expansion to enhance equitable access across the borough. With an average trip length at or under 20 minutes across the boroughs, the data further informs how residents integrate bike-sharing into their daily routines, providing valuable context for optimizing service, fleet management, and future infrastructure planning.
